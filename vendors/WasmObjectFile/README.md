Wasm Object File
===
A library to output [WebAssembly object files](https://github.com/WebAssembly/tool-conventions/blob/master/Linking.md).

The code here is copied and slightly modified from the [WebAssembly spec implementation](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec). Also code is taken from this [experimental WebAssembly backend for OCaml](https://github.com/SanderSpies/ocaml).
